## üöÄ **COMPLETE - Tasks & Roles Implementation!**

I've successfully implemented the complete Tasks CRUD system with role-based permissions and team member management!

---

## ‚úÖ **What's Been Implemented**

### **1. Role-Based Permissions System** (`utils/permissions.py`)
- ‚úÖ Complete RBAC with 4 roles: Owner, Manager, Developer, Viewer
- ‚úÖ Permission enums for all actions
- ‚úÖ Role-permission mapping
- ‚úÖ Helper functions: `get_user_role_in_project()`, `check_permission()`, `can_edit_task()`, etc.
- ‚úÖ Fine-grained permission checking (owners/managers can edit any task, developers only their own)

### **2. Custom Exceptions** (`utils/exceptions.py`)
- ‚úÖ `MemberAlreadyExistsException` (409)
- ‚úÖ `InvalidRoleException` (400)
- ‚úÖ `CannotRemoveOwnerException` (400)
- ‚úÖ `UserNotFoundException` (404)
- ‚úÖ `InsufficientPermissionsException` (403)

### **3. Task Models** (`models/project.py`)
- ‚úÖ `TaskUpdate` - Update task request
- ‚úÖ `TaskStatusUpdate` - Quick status change
- ‚úÖ `TaskListResponse` - Task list with count

### **4. Tasks CRUD API** (`routes/tasks.py`)

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Permission |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| `/projects/{id}/tasks` | POST | Create task | CREATE_TASK |
| `/projects/{id}/tasks` | GET | Get all tasks | VIEW_TASK |
| `/projects/{id}/tasks/{tid}` | GET | Get task details | VIEW_TASK |
| `/projects/{id}/tasks/{tid}` | PUT | Update task | EDIT_TASK* |
| `/projects/{id}/tasks/{tid}` | DELETE | Delete task | DELETE_TASK** |
| `/projects/{id}/tasks/{tid}/status` | PATCH | Update status | UPDATE_TASK_STATUS |

*Developers can only edit their own tasks  
**Only owners and managers

### **5. Team Management API** (`routes/roles.py`)

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Permission |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| `/projects/{id}/members` | POST | Add member | Owner only |
| `/projects/{id}/members` | GET | Get members | Member |
| `/projects/{id}/members/{user}` | PUT | Update role | Owner only |
| `/projects/{id}/members/{user}` | DELETE | Remove member | Owner only |
| `/projects/{id}/members/{user}` | GET | Get member info | Member |
| `/projects/{id}/members/{user}/permissions` | GET | Get permissions | Member |

### **6. Helper Functions** (`utils/helpers.py`)
- ‚úÖ `log_task_assignment()` - Track assignments
- ‚úÖ `calculate_project_progress()` - Auto-calculate progress
- ‚úÖ `get_user_task_count()` - User workload stats
- ‚úÖ `format_task_summary()` - Readable summaries

### **7. Enhanced Middleware** (`utils/middleware.py`)
- ‚úÖ `require_role()` - Role-based dependencies
- ‚úÖ `require_project_owner()` - Owner-only dependency
- ‚úÖ `require_project_member()` - Member-only dependency
- ‚úÖ `require_permission()` - Permission-based dependency

### **8. Updated Projects Routes**
- ‚úÖ GET `/projects` now includes user's role in each project
- ‚úÖ GET `/projects/{id}` includes user's role
- ‚úÖ Enhanced with role information

### **9. Main App Updates** (`app/main.py`)
- ‚úÖ Registered tasks router
- ‚úÖ Registered roles router
- ‚úÖ Added exception handlers for all new exceptions

## üß™ **Complete Testing Checklist**

### **Tasks CRUD**
- [ ] Create task as owner
- [ ] Create task as manager
- [ ] Create task as developer
- [ ] Try create task as viewer (should fail)
- [ ] Get all tasks
- [ ] Get single task
- [ ] Update task as owner
- [ ] Update own task as developer
- [ ] Try update other's task as developer (should fail)
- [ ] Quick status update
- [ ] Assign task to team member
- [ ] Try assign task to non-member (should fail)
- [ ] Delete task as owner
- [ ] Delete task as manager
- [ ] Try delete task as developer (should fail)

### **Team Management**
- [ ] Add team member as owner
- [ ] Try add member as manager (should fail)
- [ ] Get all members
- [ ] Update member role as owner
- [ ] Try update role as manager (should fail)
- [ ] Get member permissions
- [ ] Remove team member as owner
- [ ] Try remove owner (should fail)
- [ ] Try add existing member (should update role)

### **Permission Testing**
- [ ] Owner can do everything
- [ ] Manager can manage tasks but not team
- [ ] Developer can only edit own tasks
- [ ] Viewer can only view
- [ ] Non-member cannot access project
- [ ] Removed member loses access

---

## üéØ **Advanced Testing Scenarios**

### **Multi-User Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Owner creates project
# 2. Owner adds manager
# 3. Manager creates tasks
# 4. Manager assigns tasks to developers
# 5. Developers update their task status
# 6. Manager monitors progress
# 7. Owner removes underperforming member
```

### **Edge Cases**

```bash
# Try to assign task to yourself
# Try to remove yourself from team
# Try to change your own role
# Try to access deleted task
# Try to add member to non-existent project
```

## üìö **Using Swagger UI**

1. Go to http://localhost:8000/docs
2. Click "Authorize" button
3. Enter: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
4. Test all endpoints interactively

**Benefits:**
- See all request/response schemas
- Try different parameter combinations
- View error responses
- Copy working curl commands

---

## üöÄ **Postman Collection**

### **Setup Environment Variables**
- `base_url`: `http://localhost:8000`
- `owner_token`: (from signup)
- `manager_token`: (from second user)
- `developer_token`: (from third user)
- `project_id`: (from project creation)
- `task_id`: (from task creation)

### **Test Flow**
1. Auth ‚Üí Signup (3 users: owner, manager, developer)
2. Projects ‚Üí Create Project (as owner)
3. Members ‚Üí Add Manager (as owner)
4. Members ‚Üí Add Developer (as owner)
5. Tasks ‚Üí Create Task (as manager)
6. Tasks ‚Üí Assign to Developer (as manager)
7. Tasks ‚Üí Update Status (as developer)
8. Members ‚Üí Get Permissions (any member)
