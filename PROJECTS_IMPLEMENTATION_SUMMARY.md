---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase

```bash
# 1. Create Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com
# 2. Copy credentials to backend/.env
# 3. Run SQL script
```

Follow detailed instructions in `backend/SETUP_SUPABASE.md`

### Step 2: Start the Server

```bash
cd backend
python run.py
```

### Step 3: Test the API

#### Create a project:
```bash
# Get token first
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/signup" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"user","password":"pass123","email":"user@example.com"}' \
  | jq -r '.token')

# Create project
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Project",
    "description": "A test project",
    "status": "active"
  }'
```

## 💡 Usage Example

Complete workflow:

    "username": "john",
    "password": "john123",
    "email": "john@example.com"
})
token = response.json()["token"]

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

# 2. Create project
project = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/projects", 
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "name": "Website Redesign",
        "description": "Q1 2024 project",
        "status": "active"
    }
).json()

project_id = project["id"]

# 3. Add team member
requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/projects/{project_id}/team",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "username": "jane",
        "role": "developer"
    }
)

# 4. Update progress
requests.put(f"{BASE_URL}/projects/{project_id}",
    headers=headers,
    json={"progress": 50}
)

# 5. Get statistics
stats = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/projects/{project_id}/stats",
    headers=headers
).json()

print(f"Project: {stats['project_name']}")
print(f"Progress: {stats['progress']}%")
print(f"Team size: {stats['team_member_count']}")
```
