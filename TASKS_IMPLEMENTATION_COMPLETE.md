# 🎉 Tasks & Roles Implementation - COMPLETE!

## ✅ **Full Implementation Summary**

I've successfully implemented a complete Tasks CRUD system with role-based permissions, team member management, and comprehensive authorization!

---

## 📦 **What's Been Delivered**

### **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** 🔐

**File**: `backend/utils/permissions.py`

#### **4 Roles with Distinct Permissions:**
- **Owner**: Full control (all permissions)
- **Manager**: Manage project & tasks, view analytics
- **Developer**: Create tasks, update own tasks, view project
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

#### **Permission Functions:**
- `get_user_role_in_project()` - Get user's role
- `check_permission()` - Check specific permission
- `can_edit_task()` - Check task edit permission
- `can_delete_task()` - Check task delete permission
- `can_assign_task()` - Check task assignment permission
- `is_project_owner()` - Check if user is owner
- `is_project_member()` - Check if user is member

---

### **2. Tasks CRUD API** 📋

**File**: `backend/routes/tasks.py`

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Role Access |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `POST /projects/{id}/tasks` | POST | Create task | Owner, Manager, Developer |
| `GET /projects/{id}/tasks` | GET | Get all tasks | All members |
| `GET /projects/{id}/tasks/{tid}` | GET | Get task details | All members |
| `PUT /projects/{id}/tasks/{tid}` | PUT | Update task | Owner, Manager, Developer* |
| `PATCH /projects/{id}/tasks/{tid}/status` | PATCH | Update status | All members** |
| `DELETE /projects/{id}/tasks/{tid}` | DELETE | Delete task | Owner, Manager |

*Developers can only edit their own tasks  
**Members can update status of their assigned tasks

#### **Key Features:**
- ✅ Create tasks with title, description, priority, status
- ✅ Assign tasks to team members
- ✅ Validate assignee is project member
- ✅ Quick status update endpoint
- ✅ Role-based edit permissions
- ✅ Track task assignments

---

### **3. Team Management API** 👥

**File**: `backend/routes/roles.py`

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Permission |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| `POST /projects/{id}/members` | POST | Add team member | Owner only |
| `GET /projects/{id}/members` | GET | Get all members | All members |
| `GET /projects/{id}/members/{user}` | GET | Get member info | All members |
| `PUT /projects/{id}/members/{user}` | PUT | Update role | Owner only |
| `DELETE /projects/{id}/members/{user}` | DELETE | Remove member | Owner only |
| `GET /projects/{id}/members/{user}/permissions` | GET | Get permissions | All members |

#### **Key Features:**
- ✅ Add members with specific roles
- ✅ Auto-update if member already exists
- ✅ Update member roles
- ✅ Remove members (cannot remove owner)
- ✅ View member permissions
- ✅ Validate roles

---

### **4. Enhanced Data Models** 📊

**File**: `backend/models/project.py`

**New Models:**
- `TaskUpdate` - Update task request (all fields optional)
- `TaskStatusUpdate` - Quick status change
- `TaskListResponse` - Task list with total count

**Enums:**
- `TaskStatus`: todo, in_progress, completed
- `TaskPriority`: low, medium, high
- `TeamMemberRole`: owner, manager, developer, viewer

---

### **5. Custom Exceptions** ⚠️

**File**: `backend/utils/exceptions.py`

**New Exceptions:**
- `MemberAlreadyExistsException` (409) - Member already in team
- `InvalidRoleException` (400) - Invalid role provided
- `CannotRemoveOwnerException` (400) - Cannot remove owner
- `UserNotFoundException` (404) - User not found
- `InsufficientPermissionsException` (403) - Lacks permission

All exceptions have custom handlers in `main.py`!

---

### **6. Helper Functions** 🛠️

**File**: `backend/utils/helpers.py`

**Assignment Tracking:**
- `log_task_assignment()` - Log when tasks are assigned
- `send_task_notification()` - Placeholder for notifications

**Analytics:**
- `calculate_project_progress()` - Auto-calculate based on completed tasks
- `get_user_task_count()` - Get user's task stats
- `get_project_member_count()` - Count team members

**Utilities:**
- `format_task_summary()` - Readable task summaries
- `format_project_summary()` - Readable project summaries
- `validate_username()`, `validate_email()` - Input validation

---

### **7. Enhanced Middleware** 🔒

**File**: `backend/utils/middleware.py`

**New Dependency Functions:**
```python
# Require specific roles
require_role(["owner", "manager"])

# Require owner role
require_project_owner()

# Require any project member
require_project_member()

# Require specific permission
require_permission(Permission.CREATE_TASK)
```

**Usage Example:**
```python
@router.delete("/projects/{project_id}")
async def delete_project(
    project_id: str,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    _: None = Depends(require_project_owner())
):
    # Only owners can access this
    ...
```

---

### **8. Updated Routes** 🔄

#### **Projects Routes Enhanced:**
- `GET /projects` - Now includes user's role in each project
- `GET /projects/{id}` - Includes user's role in response

#### **Main App Updated:**
- Registered tasks router
- Registered roles router  
- Added all new exception handlers
- Updated imports
